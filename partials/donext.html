      <h2 data-section="intro" class="sans subhead">When you get past the small talk, <br />communication is always about intent.</h2>
      
      <p>We live our lives connected to more people than ever before. And quite often, our interaction is occasional, across many disconnected channels. This makes finding time to <strike>engage</strike> spend with these connections hard.</p>

      <p>Or to put it a different way, there’s a difference between <strong>wanting to</strong> and making things happen: (also known as the <a href=“http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3451-what-s-up-with-the-san-francisco-yes” target=“_blank”>San Francisco Yes</a>)</p>

      <p>On the surface, DoNext may not seem related to this: after all, it looks and acts like a productivity app. However, by bringing elements that keep you on point from the productivity world (calendars, reminders, to-dos) and integrating it into a messaging system, it becomes a powerful (and accountable) way to make things happen: texting someone to &lsquo;get coffee&rsquo; is now instantly an event: every person&rsquo;s availability is checked, and then added across  their calendars. Changes to time and location are synced. A common checklist is shared. Finally, everyone&rsquo;s on the same page.</p>

      <p>DoNext has many, incredibly forward thinking ideas that are just about ready for release: intelligent automatic messaging if you&rsquo;re running late, talking to the Internet of Things, and much more. Stay tuned.</p>

      <h2 data-section="role" class="sans subhead">My Role</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m the lead (<em>read: only</em>) product designer on DoNext, and thus my responsibilities include the app, marketing collateral and other visual assets. I&rsquo;m also involved in the day-to-day development of the web prototype, and often add hotfixes and even the occasional feature to the Sinatra backend. Recently, I&rsquo;ve also taken up a significant amount of responsibility in promoting and distributing the app. While this spread worries me for the inability to really dwell on something completely, I&rsquo;ve accepted it as a nature of doing what is most important.</p>
      <p>To mitigate risks and validate decisions, I also spend a lot of time prototyping and using analytics for insights: thus, I spend a lot of time implementing multi-variate tests via Mixpanel, Google Analytics and Ruby/JavaScript.</p>
      <h2 data-section="process" class="sans subhead">Designing <span style="text-transform:none">DoNext</span></h2>
      <p>DoNext is a delightful challenge to design around. By nature, we&rsquo;re combining an asynchronous messaging system with elements from Calendars and reminders which necessitate synchronization. Conveying what happens when you press a button becomes crucial when you&rsquo;re introducing new metaphors: often necessitating custom controls, just-in-time tutorials, and many interations of interface copywriting</p> 
      <p>To balance the needs of these new directions with the realities that come in a two-person team (myself + a developer),  my approach has been to create a modular, highly editable design system that I can go back to and change easily. That&rsquo;s why most of DoNext is designed on Sketch:</p>
      <img src="/img/portfolio/donext/componentlib.png" title="DoNext Component Library" alt="DoNext Component Library"/>
      <p>To expedite development, I&rsquo;ve created a component library that&rsquo;s constantly updated (which helps easy export of assets) and contains every block of the app, in every possible state (highlighted, active, inactive, error... the works). This helps in many ways: quick screenshots for marketing collateral, or to try a new direction is as easy as draggging and dropping LEGO blocks. And over the long run, it gives a great birds-eye view of the design system: what works, what doesn’t, what looks dated. This allows for components themselves to be constantly updated as needed without requiring big redesign or refactor sprints - again, extremely important in a one-person design team.</p>
      <p>Before an idea is committed to code though, there&rsquo;s a significant amount of prototyping involved: I usually do this via Marvel or XCode (while testing for flow) or Quartz Composer (while testing for fidelity).</p>

      <p>In general, I like to expose ideas early and often: however, for a number of reasons, this was not possible with DoNext: my strategy then involved using a large number of events stored to capture user states and transitions (this was done via Mixpanel), and creating targeted email and push notifications to verify if users understood the system. I also helped implement a progressive reduction on the UI where features resolved to their final look after users completely understood the flow and intention of each action.</p>
