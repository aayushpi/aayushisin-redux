      <h1>Messaging with intent {A work in progress}</h1>

      <h2 data-section="intro" class="sans subhead">Often, communication is intent: something to do, or something to do together.</h2>
      <p>On the surface, DoNext is a productivity app: and I use it as such daily. It merges calendars, reminders and tasks in a single view: which are pulled via smart-integrations with iOS (Calendar, Reminder Synch, Siri), and soon with a number of services.</p>
      <p>Already, DoNext is better than that: the greatest problem with productivity apps is that, at some point in time, they break down: burdened by the weight of a million ideas captured, they cause a sense of encumbrance: leading to the <strong>very procrastination</strong> you were hoping to avoid. DoNext tries to solve this in a number of ways: for one, it&rsquo;s highly opinionated and asks you to focus on the immediates even if you are planning long-term. It also encourages sharing tasks, making them twice as accountable. And by smartly meshing tasks in the spaces that exist between meetings and other scheduled activities, you get a simple, no non-sense lineup for the day.</p>
      <h2 class="sans subhead">An articulation of intent</h2>
      <p>But DoNext aims to be more than just that: we aim to make it an articulation of intent - which is possibly the one thing that the modern, sensor-packed smartphone cannot guess. And when you can add time, location and people to this intent, powerful things can happen. Tasks that should happen <em>someday</em> down the line can be done now: that insurance renewal which has been pending for a year gets done because you&rsquo;re a block away from State Farm, or the boxes that need packing get done on time because you connected the app to Task Rabbit.</p>
      <p>On dogfooding my own app, Iâ€™ve found a greater sense of purpose and inspiration when the things that I need to do today, are on the same list with books to read/study, and longer term life goals. My purpose in life has changed from a <em>I&rsquo;ll get to this someday</em> to <em>This is next</em>.</p>
      <h2 data-section="role" class="sans subhead">My Role</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m the lead (<em>read: only</em>) product designer on DoNext, and thus my responsibilities include the app, marketing collateral and other visual assets. I&rsquo;m also involved in the day-to-day development of the web prototype, and often add hotfixes and even the occasional feature to the Sinatra backend. Recently, I&rsquo;ve also taken up a significant amount of responsibility in promoting and distributing the app. While this spread worries me for the inability to really dwell on something completely, I&rsquo;ve accepted it as a nature of doing what is most important.</p>
      <p>To mitigate risks and validate decisions, I also spend a lot of time prototyping and using analytics for insights: thus, I spend a lot of time implementing multi-variate tests via Mixpanel, Google Analytics and Ruby/JavaScript.</p>
      <h2 data-section="process" class="sans subhead">Designing <span style="text-transform:none">DoNext</span></h2>
      <p>DoNext has, admittedly, been a challenge to design around. It&rsquo;s been the first time that I don&rsquo;t set the sole (or even primary) voice of the brand: it started out as a tool for small-business owners, and has become a lot more consumer facing after multiple pivots. While designing the app, I&rsquo;m constantly respecting the time and extremely scarce resources we operate with: this often means that we don&rsquo;t (sadly) have the time to build custom controls, add meaningful animations (unless they&rsquo;re an extreme necessity) or double-down on the production of slick assets. Instead, my approach has been to create a modular, highly editable design system that I can go back to and change easily.</p>
      <img src="/img/portfolio/donext/componentlib.png" title="DoNext Component Library" alt="DoNext Component Library"/>
      <p>Most of DoNext is visually designed on Sketch: I create a component library that&rsquo;s constantly updated for 1x and 2x assets which contain every block of the app, in every possible state (highlighted, active, inactive, error... the works). This allows for the components themselves to be constantly updated as needed without requiring big redesign or refactor sprints.</p>
      <p>Before an idea is committed to Sketch though, there&rsquo;s a significant amount of prototyping involved: I usually do this via Marvel (while testing for flow) or Quartz Composer (while testing for fidelity).</p>
      <p>In general, I like to expose ideas early and often: however, for a number of reasons, this was not possible with DoNext: my strategy then involved using a large number of events stored to capture user states and transitions (this was done via Mixpanel), and creating targeted email notifications to verify if users understood the system. I also helped implement a progressive reduction on the UI where features resolved to their final look after users completely understood the flow and intention of each action.</p>
      <h2 class="sans subhead">Being Built With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketch + Illustrator + PaintCode + Photoshop <span class="sans">{Design}</span></li>
        <li>Ruby + Sinatra + PostgreSQL <span class="sans">{Development}</span></li>
        <li>Xcode + Quartz Composer + Pixate + Marvel <span class="sans">{Prototyping}</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>DoNext is a work in progress that gets better with every release. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo-today-task-list-calendar/id898004872?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vpA6&ct=aayush">Give it a try</a>, then let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
