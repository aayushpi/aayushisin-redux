      <h2 data-section="aayush" class="sans subhead">This Guy</h2>
      <p>Hi. I&rsquo;m Aayush (<em>ah-you-shh</em>) Iyer. I do what&rsquo;s needed to solve problems using design, code, words &amp; thinking. I&rsquo; have over 8 years of experience with design: across advertising, journalism, photography and digital products. I aim to bring empathy, critical thinking and cross-cultural insight to every situation.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m an avid fan of Jazz and cinema. I sport a nearly-unhealthy interest in training Mixed Martial Arts, and care deeply about communities and tribes that are neglected or relegated: especially sex workers and the spectrum of people around them.</p>
      <p>This is the last résumé I designed. It&rsquo;s due for some updates:</p>
      <img src="/img/resume.png" title="STATION IDENT" alt="STATION IDENT"/>
      <p>Before moving to Boulder, Colorado to attend the BDW program, I served as the Associate Creative Director at GREY&rsquo;s Digital arm in Mumbai, spearheading the efforts of brands like Volkswagen and DELL, as well as new business pitches.</p>
      <p>In Boulder, I happily made the long-planned jump from advertising and communication to product, by launching <a href="http://www.aayushis.in/#piq">piq</a>, a jukebox for social spaces. While the Kickstarter <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piq/piq-a-jukebox-for-social-spaces">failed spectacularly</a></strong>, I&rsquo;ve learned much from it. And, who knows, it <del>might</del> will come back in a different form</p>
      <p>With a solid foundation in code and working experience with print, I value tools lesser than the processes used to solve problems. I might design with Sketch on one day, and spend another day with XCode - whatever helps solve faster, and better.</p>
      <p>At some point in the future, I&rsquo;d love to have the time to make a personal style guide. For now, here it is: <span style="color:#F03838">#F03838</span>,<span style="color:#fce2e0">#FCE2E0</span>, <span style="color:#2c3e50">#2C3E50</span>, <span class="sans" style="color:#f03838"><em><a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/atrament-web">ATRAMENT WEB</a></em></span>, and <a style="color:black" href="https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-serif-web-pro">Meta Serif Web Pro.</a></p>
      <h2 data-section="you" class="sans subhead">Let’s talk</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m happily working on helping people accomplish their goals and do great things together with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo-today-task-list-calendar/id898004872?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vpA6&ct=aayush">DoNext</a>. Give it a try - I&rsquo;d love to get some feedback. Passion projects in certain disciplines also matter immensely for me: if you&rsquo;d like help with your social justice project (particularly if it focuses on, or flirts with the work of sex work), send me an <a href="mailto:contact@aayushis.in">email</a>. I&rsquo;ll get back to you fairly quickly</p>
      <p>Of course, I&rsquo;m also available to talk about anything interesting that you&rsquo;re cooking up, or for a cup of coffee (pourovers are best). I am pretty easy to reach via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aayush">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <h2 data-section="you" class="sans subhead">This Site</h2>
      <p>This site was designed and developed within a day, about a year ago. My coding skills were lesser then, but in spite of multiple reviews, I&rsquo;m quite happy with how it represents me.</p>
      <p>If you must know, it&rsquo;s mostly flat files, connected with a <em>Backbone.js</em> router for modular updates, and optimized at save with an off-the-shelf Grunt script. Of course, there are a few improvements in the pipeline for this site. Namely:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Converting HTML partials to Markdown for easy edits</li>
        <li>A little more diversity in layout options for images</li>
        <li>Redesigning the mobile template - which in itself is a question about what it means to have a mobile site today</li>
        <li>PageSpeed optimizations - #1 being inline CSS for the first load</li>
        <li>HTTP Request optimizations</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I&rsquo;ll get to these someday. I like putting stuff away: so <a href="https://github.com/aayushpi/aayushisin-redux">here&rsquo;s the source for this website</a>: you&rsquo;re free to use any of the code in any way, shape or form. Good pull requests are most appreaciated</p>
