    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/piq/piq&#45;diagram.png" title="The piq experience" alt="The piq experience"/> -->

    <!--   <blockquote>It was time to break free of this sonic tyranny: it was time for a music democracy.</blockquote> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="role" class="sans subhead">My Role</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>I designed &#38;amp; developed the original piq prototype in a sixteen&#45;hour sprint that involved Caffeine, more Caffeine, <em>jQuery Mobile</em> &#38;amp; a <em>Raspberry PI</em>.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Once we decided to make a business out of it, I took on the role of CEO and focused on the Business Development, Visual Design and Marketing of piq. Of course, as is the case in any startup, <strong>you have to do everything</strong>. I've talked about my <a href="https://medium.com/design&#45;startups/a12142e9ab28">experiences running piq in a post on Medium</a>.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="process" class="sans subhead">The Pitch &#45; What is piq? How did you build it?</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>piq is a jukebox for social spaces: a democratic way for anyone to have a say in what plays in the space around you. The tiny $99 hardware device was the first articulation of this idea &#45; connect it to your speakers and a music source of your choice, and you instantly have a crowd&#45;powered jukebox (controlled by web apps for a phone/tablet/PC): one that connects social spaces tightly.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>We operated piq on three key principles:</p> -->
    <!--   <ol> -->
    <!--     <li>Don’t build anything unless you have to.</li> -->
    <!--     <li>When in doubt, ask the customer. When not in doubt, ask anyway.</li> -->
    <!--     <li>Run lean, run agile but more than anything else, run.</li> -->
    <!--   </ol> -->
    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/piq/piq&#45;prototype_evolution.jpg" title="The evolution of piq's prototypes" alt="The evolution of piq's prototypes"/> -->
    <!--   <p>Creating hardware is tough &#45; especially in a three month timeframe, and this helped us value every decision and task undertaken. This quickly defined piq’s strategy, as we created the barest of prototypes and put them in front of potential customers, allowing them to <em>imagine the product in their context</em>.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>From this, we observed patterns that allowed us to build faster, better, and in much less time. It also gave us a following, as <strong>3 sales, 11 installed units, 20 live demos and 500 users</strong> guided piq to its launch state.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="design" class="sans subhead">Branding &#38;amp; Design</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>piq is an articulation of the essential human yearnings of empowerment (control of music), community (a shared musical experience) and delight (a bloody good song). piq's brand reflected the same.</p> -->
    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/piq/piq&#45;brand_cards.jpg" title="The piq Brand + Brand Signal" alt="The piq Brand + Brand Signal"/> -->
    <!--   <p>The name is obviously derived from "pick", the essential act of empowerment, and queues &#45; the familiar context of a jukebox. Paired together, it made a brand that looked suspiciously like two people sharing an experience… which was what we were all about.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>The name also provided a memorable, disruptive industrial design which clearly differentiated from an army of Apple TV clones. After multiple prototypes sketched, rendered and 3D Printed, the final form factor was designed to be built with a plastic&#45;injection moulded treatment, it instantly reminded people of a music device and served as a powerful indicator that <em>you can choose what plays here</em>.</p> -->
    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/piq/piq_hardware_prototyping.jpg" title="piq's Industrial Design Evolution" alt="piq's Industrial Design Evolution"/> -->

    <!--   <p>I presented piq at a number of events in the Denver area, including Boulder NewTech, a gathering of 400+ people across startups, providers and tech/design enthusiasts. It was eventually presented at BDW's PitchFest and adjudged the winner for the year. Keep a lookout for my varying degrees of facial hair too.</p> -->

    <!--   <p>When Volkswagen became the official sponsor for the <em>DLF IPL</em> &#45; the biggest event in cricket, we merged technology and information design into a tasty peripheral for every sports fan.

    <!--   <p>The visualization wasn't a one&#45;way street though &#45; since cricket fans love to rant, we integrated Twitter reactions and cherry&#45;picked the best ones straight into the LIVE interface.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Volkswagen LIVE was available on every screen that you could ask for: PC and dedicated Adobe AIR editions served the traditional desktop/laptop user while dynamic editions for the mobile user base were also available, which were served via QR codes on the interface. Volkswagen LIVE also debuted on the then brand&#45;new Chrome Webstore, becoming a pioneer of sorts of true web apps.</p> -->

    <!--   <p>Volkswagen LIVE utilized a live ball&#45;by&#45;ball feed to compute and generate visualizations on the fly. Every time a delivery was registered, each widget was recalculated, and the browser rendered animations for this instantly. The animation itself was designed accounting for different browsers and their unique quirks. This allowed us to progressively enhance the visual for advanced browsers (in case of which, Vector graphics were used to render the widgets) while allowing a usable experience for older browsers via a graceful CSS degradation.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>This responsive design was also made to account for Mobile users. Webkit (iPhone/iPad/Android) users received a custom stylesheet which enabled touch metaphors for Volkswagen LIVE, allowing them to swipe through widgets. The mobile edition also delivered a refined typographic set, that allowed for easy reading on small&#45;screens (which is crucial for people viewing the interface on&#45;the&#45;go).</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Twitter reactions were curated by a custom Twitter engine that picked tweets based on popular, relevant topics (such as #ipl or #cricket).</p> -->
    <!--   <p>These tweets were further filtered based on social graph data which allowed us to calculate the popularity of the Tweet. This meant that the snippets of commentary displayed were always of high quality.</p> -->

    <!--   <p>I'm a motor head, and being entrusted with the creative direction of Volkswagen's digital activities (at GREY's Digital arm in Mumbai) was a lot of fun. In 2011, We were tasked with launching the all&#45;new Volkswagen Jetta with a digitally&#45;spearheaded integrated campaign: one that would create conversations about the car and significantly boost its perception and desirability.</p> -->
    <!--   <blockquote>The brains behind the largest twitter campaign for a brand ever in a single country, Aayush conceptualised and led Digital 360 initiative which included OOH activations, display advertising (including an ingenious twitter hack on a display property), web videos and an evocative HTML5 website. <span class="sans">Navin Kansal {ECD, Grey Mumbai}</span></blockquote> -->
    <!--   <p>To execute this, it was crucial to create a proposition that would thrill our audiences and entice them to participate. Social Media formed the primary channel for our campaign: one where our message and its reactions would define the campaign ideal, which was then translated via smart use of other digital channels to bolster conversations. We also augmented the campaign by use of Print, Tactical Outdoor and selected Television</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="idea" class="sans subhead">The Idea</h2> -->
    <!--   <div class="embed"> -->
    <!--     <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32892178?byline=0&#38;amp;portrait=0&#38;amp;color=f03838" width="640" height="512" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> -->
    <!--   </div> -->
    <!--   <p>To enthuse the spirit of participation, we devised a simple&#45;yet&#45;addictive challenge: Tell us what you’d do for the all&#45;new Jetta. If the crowd likes your answer, you drive home with one.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Twitter was our primary platform: users participated by adding the “anything4jetta” hashtag to their tweets. Very quickly, it became the next big trend to catch on to. It also instigated competition: “If you do #anything4jetta, I can do one better”.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Our audiences could Tweet responses, or make a stronger case with a unique creation. A point system ensured that the process wasn’t chaotic: regular tweets scored two points, while pictures or video got a bonus. We further augmented participation by adding Voice and SMS (extremely critical in a nascent digital market). Users could text tweets or (for the first time ever), record tweet&#45;clips on the phone.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>The campaign launched in the Times of India, supported with an interactive display campaign, and a Jetta was up for grabs.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="role" class="sans subhead">My Role</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>I conceived the original campaign idea and led the creative direction for the website, seeded media and all digital extensions. After an initial prototype, I worked with the good people at <em>It's Alive</em> to execute the deliverables.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="technology" class="sans subhead">Technology</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>Every element of our campaign converged on #anything4jetta, which herded responses across channels to increase user participation and scale. These were visualized via an elegant HTML5/CSS3 solution on www.anything4jetta.com.</p> -->
    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/a4j/a4j&#45;map.png" title="anything4jetta: Campaign Visualization" alt="anything4jetta: Campaign Visualization"/> -->
    <!--   <p>The solution employed some creative uses of edge HTML5 components such as SVG and Canvas, in order to properly render and animate the tweet bubbles in the showcase. Custom animations were written from scratch for the bubbles, which floated around randomly, and were scaled when interacted with.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>And since the client absolutely <strong>insisted</strong> on display advertising, we hacked a way to Live Tweet from within a banner property (#anything4jetta was automatically appended). Tweet&#45;Tracking banners introduced people to the campaign with real&#45;time responses, and regular recognition kept the pace of the campaign consistent.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="results" class="sans subhead">Houston, We Have Liftoff</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>anything4jetta became the most successful car launch in India almost instantly, and is still considered a benchmark against which social&#45;media powered campaigns are measured.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>The campaign launched with the daily newspaper (at the break of dawn), and was <strong>trending within 20 minutes</strong>. A few hours in, #anything4jetta was trending #1, and <strong>by noon had broken records for social media campaigns in India</strong>. The campaign registered 2,75,000+ Tweets, was talked about in 200+ blogs and generated 10,00,000+ media impressions.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>With a <strong>peak activity of 3000+ Tweets/hour</strong> the campaign became a national movement, and triggered an increase in car sales by a massive 58% (stunning for a luxury brand).</p> -->

    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="intro" class="sans subhead">In India,test&#45;drives are an exercise in timidity. This was the fix</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>Volkswagen gave us a fitting challenge in the beginning of 2012: amidst rising (<em>and frankly, ridiculous</em>) prices, we were tasked with launching the Petrol variant of the Jetta. Expectations were also amplified since this was the first follow&#45;up to the anything4jetta campaign, which was very well received.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Our objective was, on the face of it, fairly simple: get people to book a Test&#45;Drive to the car. But as is always the case, the truth is a lot more interesting (and complex). India’s a unique car market &#45; people buy cars for the long haul: it’s an object of extreme durability, and is cared for almost obsessively. However, in spite of it being a significant commitment of time, emotion and money, the test&#45;drive experience is an exercise in timidity.</p> -->
    <!--   <blockquote>India's first ever direct video response campaign was Aayush's brainchild. Housed on a Youtube custom gadget, the campaign became the hub around which conventional advertising also converged. He scripted most of the videos and was also involved in the production and post production of the same.<span class="sans">Navin Kansal {ECD, Grey Mumbai}</span></blockquote> -->
    <!--   <p>Either by cultural/societal bias, or simply because no precedent has been set, most test&#45;drives involve a slow, overly careful spin around a block and a few trivial questions about the car itself.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>We saw an opportunity to make a change, and bring some excitement into the process of selection, by creating a genuinely fun campaign that allowed users to let go of their inhibitions and test out the car (as well as the brand).</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="idea" class="sans subhead">What if we allowed users to be truly uninhibited, and test drive the car from the comfort of their screens?</h2> -->

    <!--   </div> -->
    <!--   <p>It all started with a simple idea: What if we allowed users to be truly uninhibited, and test drive the car from the comfort of their screens? Thus, the YouTube test&#45;drive was born: ask a question, any question about the Jetta TSI, and you’ll find an answer (but perhaps not the one you expected).</p> -->
    <!--   <p>To do so, we pre&#45;seeded 10 videos and launched a HTML5 YouTube property that allowed users to log questions, and view the answers as soon as they were made available. Behind the screen, an &#45;army of copywriters&#45; myself and two brave followers waited for every new question: caffeinated, pencils sharpened and wit tempered. Scripts to questions were written &#45; some quick, others elaborate and some simply outrageous &#45; that answered every question: no matter how good or bad.</p> -->

    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="role" class="sans subhead">My Role</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>I conceived the creative thought for the campaign, defined the aesthetic look of the site and wrote a majority of its films. Once prototyped, we worked with the teams at <em>Bombay Works</em> and <em>Google India</em> to bring it to life.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="process" class="sans subhead">The Process</h2> -->
    <!--   <img src="/img/portfolio/tsi/tsi&#45;prototypes.jpg" title="The YouTube Test&#45;Drive Prototypes" alt="The YouTube Test&#45;Drive Prototypes"/> -->
    <!--   <p>The Jetta TSI was my first attempt at <em>rapid&#45;prototyping a campaign</em>. Instead of simply selling the idea of a campaign, we found the most glamorous account director at GREY, a spare Volkswagen and a Canon 5D to shoot a spec ad, and then took the client through the user journey of asking a question, and receiving a video response.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>The prototyping session helped immensely: we knew instantly that we would be inundated by the crowd, and this helped us arm ourselves with tools to mitigate repeated questions, trolls and spam.</p> -->
    <!--   <p>Once approved, we sealed our fate for the next three months &#45; days and nights spent crafting the Front&#45;end experience, finding the right actor (<em>30% Jeremy Clarkson, 30% David Caruso, 40% Richard Branson</em>… we eventually settled.), creating an interesting story arc for the campaign featuring a singular narrator, tone&#45;of&#45;voice and an army of disposable extras aptly uniformed <em>INTERN</em>.</p> -->
    <!--   <h2 data&#45;section="results" class="sans subhead">All leading to this&#38;hellip;</h2> -->
    <!--   <p>The YouTube Test&#45;Drive was a critical hit, and once again broke new ground in digital car launches. 750,000+ unique test&#45;drives (that's about <strong>450,000 hours</strong> of video viewed) and 517 video responses shot the Jetta TSI into the spotlight, trigger a stunning 1200% increase in real&#45;world test&#45;drives.</p> -->
